InterviewApp
============

Hi Jose,

This is the test application you asked me to. 

The application is fully functional and I added some features that I thing you will be interest to see.

Features:

- Self implementation of a simple cache on the Json request to the server validating the information:
If the application is open and running, it will save the data in a variable that will stand until the app is completely closed,
doing this I avoid making new request to the server for the information, them when the user come back to the app the ListView will
have all the information without requesting it to the server.

- Check Network state:
The Application will not start if the mobile doesn't have internet connection, it will raise a TOAST telling the user that is not connected to
the internet and that it should try again when it's connected.

- The application has its own style, with background color, text color to accomplish a better look.

- I decided to avoid using any type of cache for the image loading, because I saw that the link is dynamic and the images are always changing.

- The Application runs perfectly in 2.3+ devices as requested.

- I didn't use any Third party library for the app, I decide to make everything from scratch.


I hope you like it,

Regards,
Daniel Sibaja Calder√≥n.
